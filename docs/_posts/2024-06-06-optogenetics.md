Notes:

Writing feels odd to me, but me writing about optogenetics **is** odd. Before today, I'd never heard of it and I still have a loose grasp of it - but writing this is more an exercise for me to actually put effort into something and publish for whoever's interested to read. 

I'm not really on social media, so a lot of my time spent killing time on my phone is using my browser to search about whatever I'm curious about that day. One day it may be rural manufacturing, the next day is industrial design or technology in agriculture. Recently, I came across a company called [Prolific Machines](https://www.prolific-machines.com/) based in California. Biology and bio-engineering isn't something I'm particularly drawn to (too far out of my scope of knowledge) but today I was a bit more motivated to learn something like this. I enjoy learning and reading about hardware or software hacking, and this seemed to be almost like cellular hacking. 

Prolific Machines is in the Food Tech news recently due to a series B1 round that raised $55 million. But what Prolific Machines does seems more life SciFi than real science. Their technology adds proteins to cells that are used to manufacture things like some ingredients in infant formula or even vaccines. 

Previously, this sort of manufacturing would be done by introducing

Optogenetics isn't new - it's been used for years in neuroscience. Take light sensetive protien from things like Algae in a pond and use them in rats or mice. Ultraviolet light or carbon dioxide detectors.
