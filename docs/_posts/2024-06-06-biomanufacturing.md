I grew up on a farm in Indiana and my professional career is in banking (with a large focus in Ag). In this environment, I get to meet lots of Purdue grads and engineers who work in agriculture, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals (Indiana is a hotspot for drug companies too).  My personal hobbies and interests revolve around designing and making things (from code and electronics to woodworking and welding to 3D printing). Biomanufacturing has always seemed interesting - making product but with biology instead of metal, plastic, or snippets of Python. The problem is I have no real background there or understanding of biology. I have decided to change that. This post is the beginning of my journey to push through that knowledge gap and learn some science. 

I recently came across this clip, which turned my spark of interest into a real desire to understand biomanufacturing on a deeper level:

Now, it would be very difficult for me to give an overall picture of biomanufacturing - there's simply too much for me to learn, understand, and regurgitate back in this article. Given my background in banking and finance, I thought the best way for me to learn is focus on a few tech companies/startups that are looking to solve problems in the space. What is the science behind the tech they've developed and what is the impact on the industry?
